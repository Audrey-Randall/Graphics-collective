So this project was originally a scene with a magician levitating and holding out his arms, making a bunch of cubes levitate.
I made the magician myself. Since we weren't supposed to load object files, I have replaced him with Oogluong, the Elder Sea Urchin.
Oogluong can also levitate cubes.

I spent about 11 hours on this project. Most of those were spent figuring out that glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST)
needs to be called before glClear(GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT), and messing with my object file. The scene you're actually
seeing probably took about four hours total.
