To run: No command line arguments are needed.

The grid overlaying the plane is just for error checking; it doesn't have texture coordinates so it's the color of the first pixel in the stone image. Shader lighting, normal mapping from a texture, and textures are working as far as I can tell! I'm super excited!

Press space to start and stop light rotation.

EXTRA STUFF:
To toggle cube rotation, press 1. Arrow keys move, and page up and page down zoom, while in an orthographic view.

Press p to swap between orthographic and perspective projections. This is still working poorly, although I found a bug in my translation between last assignment and now.

w, a, s, and d work like video game controls: w steps forward, s backward, a and d strafe. These controls only work properly in perspective. I've limited the frame rate to 60 fps.

I had a stab at mouse-controlled movement since last assignment also. Hold the right mouse button and drag for some very interesting bugs, especially in orthographic view.

I spent about 12 hours on this project total.
