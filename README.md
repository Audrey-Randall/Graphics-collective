To run: No command line arguments are needed.

I sent you an email about this, but here's the short version:

So this project was an attempt to port all my code over to use shaders, and was a complete failure. An hour ago I had it working, or at least displaying a texture, and then I changed something and it broke everything and I couldn't fix it. Turns out trying to use shaders is REALLY REALLY HARD. I don't have enough time to start from scratch tonight, which I think is what I'll have to do to get this working. For what it's worth, I think this is pretty close to at least being able to display a texture based on the pixel's absolute position in the window? As far as I know there's only one wrong line of code somewhere in all this junk...

Press space to start and stop light rotation.

EXTRA STUFF:
To toggle cube rotation, press 1. Arrow keys move, and page up and page down zoom, while in an orthographic view.

Press p to swap between orthographic and perspective projections. This is still working poorly, although I found a bug in my translation between last assignment and now.

w, a, s, and d work like video game controls: w steps forward, s backward, a and d strafe. These controls only work properly in perspective. I've limited the frame rate to 60 fps.

I had a stab at mouse-controlled movement since last assignment also. Hold the right mouse button and drag for some very interesting bugs, especially in orthographic view.

I spent about 12 hours on this project total.
